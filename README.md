Project Overview:

The Blur Image Detection CNN Model is a deep learning project focused on classifying images as either sharp or blurred.

It leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically extract spatial patterns and detect blur levels.

Key Objectives:

Build a reliable model to distinguish blurred images from sharp ones.

Provide an easy-to-understand framework suitable for beginners in AI/ML.

Demonstrate end-to-end project flow, including preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

Methodology:

Load and preprocess a dataset containing sharp and blurred images.

Train a CNN model with multiple convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.

Use classification layers to output blur detection results.

Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve.

Visualize training results with graphs for loss and accuracy trends.

Applications:

Useful in fields like photography, surveillance, medical imaging, and quality control.

Ensures only clear and focused images are retained for analysis.

Outcome:

A beginner-friendly AI project that combines practical image classification tasks with strong evaluation techniques.
